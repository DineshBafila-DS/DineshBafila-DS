### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I have finished my master in Computer Engineering in the year 2021.

During my masters, my research work was based on Image Processing. I have used a drone (DJI Mavic Pro) to capture the aerial image of the field. After that, I have applied the Randomized Hough Transform (RHT) Algorithm to detect the boundaries of the field. I have also identified those places in the field where crops are present. I have also worked on a project named "Border Surveillance System using Wireless Sensor Network". This project was funded by TEQIP. Apart from that, I have also worked on a project named "Scare away birds and animal presents on the field using Drone". I Have Good Experience in working with Raspberry pi, Sensors and Drone.
I have done a project in Machine learning name "House Price Prediction using Linear Regression".

My areas of interest include Machine Learning, Deep Leaning, Data Science, Image Processing and IoT.

I believe that my strongest attributes are intuitive thinking, the ability to understand from different perspectives and an independent self-drive to work on valuable and interesting things. I am a curious polymath seeking to apply ideas from one field to the other by working in unexplored intersections.
